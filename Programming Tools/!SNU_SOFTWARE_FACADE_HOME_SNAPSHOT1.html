<H1>Interactive story games > Façade</H2>
<H3>"Façade" is an interactive stageplay. You take the role of a friend of a married couple who is invited to their appartment to have some cocktails and a dinner with them. But very soon it becomes clear that their relationship is somewhere near a breakdown and it's your task to find out what's going on and to help them (or to destroy their relationship if you like that better).
<H3>Here's what the developers wrote about the game:
<H3>Façade is an artificial intelligence-based art/research experiment in electronic narrative – an attempt to move beyond traditional branching or hyper-linked narrative to create a fully-realized, one-act interactive drama. Integrating an interdisciplinary set of artistic practices and artificial intelligence technologies, we have completed a five year collaboration to engineer a novel architecture for supporting emotional, interactive character behavior and drama-managed plot. Within this architecture we have built a dramatically interesting, real-time 3D virtual world inhabited by computer-controlled characters, in which the player experiences a story from a first-person perspective. Façade was publicly released as a freeware download/CD-Rom in July 2005.
<H3>You, the player, using your own name and gender, play the character of a longtime friend of Grace and Trip, an attractive and materially successful couple in their early thirties. During an evening get-together at their apartment that quickly turns ugly, you become entangled in the high-conflict dissolution of Grace and Trip's marriage. No one is safe as the accusations fly, sides are taken and irreversible decisions are forced to be made. By the end of this intense one-act play you will have changed the course of Grace and Trip's lives – motivating you to re-play the drama to find out how your interaction could make things turn out differently the next time. (taken from the official homepage)
<H3>You use the keyboard to communicate with Grace and Trip and to answer their questions. The parser understands lots of words and phrases (or at least tries to make sense of the stuff you wrote), but sometimes you have to type quite quickly to interrupt Grace and Trip and change the direction of their conversation (which isn't easy at all).
